Welcome to the new Noook Foundation website!

NOOOK Foundation is a youth-powered non-profit dedicated to creating change, one stitch at a time.

Through the art of crochet, young hands craft beautiful items that help raise funds for youth and families in need.

Every handmade item is a promise: that love is alive, that communities can rise, and that new beginnings are possible.

We believe that even the smallest hands can shape a brighter world.

Stay tuned for more updates on our blog, and subscribe to our newsletter: The Nookazine to stay abreast of upcoming crochet events near you! (currently only in the Greater Seattle area)
